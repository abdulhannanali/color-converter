A simple microservice to convert the color from RGB to hex and vice versa.
The main purpose of building this service is to write tests for it using Mocha/Chai
and also apply Continuous Integration on it using TravisCI.

This microservce was built by following this [tutorial](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-node-js-and-mocha),
it's a nice article for anyone who wants to get started with testing using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
